# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective
CS 250 Module 7 final project. 

**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**

Interpreting user needs into a program can be a difficult task. First, we need to understand what the user needs are generally. What should this product do? To do so, we need to get user feedback either by survey or in-person meetings. 
Next, we convert those needs into user stories which allow us to describe features of the project from the perspective of the user. It gives the team the ability to see what the purpose of a feature or task is.
User stories help keep the product focused on the user's needs, improve flexibility by allowing the PO to prioritize different user stories, and help improve collaboration. 

**How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**

I approach developing a program by starting with clear requirements or a problem. Then making a plan and if needed, completing it iteratively. Ensuring that the software does what it's supposed to do or passes the needed test cases is also important.
There are a lot of agile processes that are beneficial to my future work. The most important to me is focusing on the user's needs. The software is being made for the use, so it should be built how they want it, not how I think it should be. I will not be the 
one using it.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**

A good team member is supportive, communicates, admits faults, and strives for growth. A good team member is someone you can trust to get work done, will help you if you need it and or tells you when there is a problem or what they are working on.
Being a good team member is more than just being good at writing code or any technical skill. They need to be able to work with others constructively.
